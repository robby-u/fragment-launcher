# Fragment Launcher

an experimental launcher & updater for .hack//fragment. only windows emulation supported. 

### **How To Use This Launcher**

1. Select an ISO to load into the launcher. (a direct rip of the JP disc is recommended)

2. Select your TelliPatch folder under the Tools menu.

3. Click "Check for New Version."

4. If a new patch is available, wait for the patcher to finish.

	* A new patch will always be available on first run. This is to load the launcher with recent date/time settings.

	* If the patcher cancels, this is because the ISO loaded into the launcher is not fit to be patched.
	
5. Enjoy your newly translated .hack//fragment ISO.

	* Don't forget to set your PCSX2 EXE before launching!
